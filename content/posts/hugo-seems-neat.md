# This is a test post for Hugo

I don't actually know what to put here.

## So here's some recommendations

- Godot
  - A baller open-source game engine. It's released under the MIT license and pretty neat.
- Manjaro Linux
  - It's like Arch, but for sane people.
- Hugo
  - It's how I'm making this website.
